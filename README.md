# Overview

A maze is procedurally generated. A minimap is featured in the top right corner to help the player navigate the maze. The player will always start in the bottom middle of the maze which is the entrance marked by a blue line. The exit is located on one of the other three walls (top, right, left) and is marked with a red line. By going through the blue line a timer will start, and will end when passing through the red line. The player's time to complete the maze will show and a new maze will generate in 5 seconds. In the bottom left corner a "New Maze" button, if pressed, will reset your timer and generate a new maze, putting you back at the start.
